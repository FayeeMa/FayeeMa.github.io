A collection of photos taken during the wonderful summer spent in [Ann Arbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan) in 2025.

I spent a wonderful summer in Ann Arbor in 2025, conducting research under the guidance of Professors Ji Zhu and Gongjun Xu at UMich. It was my first time traveling abroad, and Ann Arbor, with its quiet charm, vibrant colors, and friendly atmosphere, proved to be the perfect destination. I captured countless photos during my time there, hoping to preserve the beauty of the city in my heart forever. 

The photos include both English and Chinese descriptions (with yellow text and blue buttons). Go Blue! ðŸ’™ðŸ’›

May I have a paper accepted by COLT after visiting Taylor & COLT?

Probably not for meâ€¦ physics isnâ€™t my strongest field. ;)

One of many dinners I had in the corridor between West Hall and Randall â€” usually Chipotle, with a lovely view through the window.

Reaching the city limit of Ann Arbor by bus. It takes nearly an hour to get to the Social Security Administration from Willowtree by bus, where I obtained my SSN.

Yingchuan, Yiran, Yuxin, and I made hotpot at home â€” absolutely delicious!

BBQ at [The Seoul](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PmTz9qLDS5CfqGwK6) with Yingchuan and Yiran. They are also undergraduate students from China conducting summer research internships at UMich. Their friendship made this journey even more colorful.

We also visited the [Ann Arbor Art Fair](https://www.theannarborartfair.com/) that day. This stall was my favorite â€” flower windows made of glass pieces, shining brightly in the sunlight.

Autumn arrived in Ann Arbor, and it was time for me to leave.
