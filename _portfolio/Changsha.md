This instant camera photo was taken with my best friend, Yilin, during our trip to Changsha. It was through Yilin that I was first introduced to instant photography, and I quickly became captivated by this fleeting yet vibrant way to capture moments. Unlike digital photos that can be easily stored, these instant prints feel fragile, yet full of life.
