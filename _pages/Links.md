# Chinese Blogs

My old blog (in Chinese): [『姑妄言之姑妄听之』](https://chiyuru.github.io/)

Some course notes (in Chinese) for statistics and mathematics courses can be found [here](https://chiyuru.github.io/tags/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6/). Some of them are incomplete, or merely a collection of scattered thoughts.

BTW, I've been a big fan of anime for over ten years, and here’s a [list](https://bgm.tv/user/chiyuru) of my collection (in Chinese). My favorite series are [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) and [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion).

# Friends
