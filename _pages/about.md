I am an undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics.

My research interests lie broadly in statistics. I investigate various problems in statistical network analysis, with a focus on graphon estimation. My research interests include community detection, signed network modeling, graphon estimation, as well as analyzing algorithm properties and robustness. I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/) at Warwick and Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) at Tsinghua. 

I am applying for a summer research internship in 2025 and planning to apply for a PhD position in Statistics for Fall 2026.
