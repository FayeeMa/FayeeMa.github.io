I am currently an undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. I will join the Statistics and Data Science PhD program at the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in Fall 2026.

My research interests primarily lie in statistical network analysis, including graphon estimation, latent space models, and generative models for structured data. I develop statistical methodologies to better understand the underlying patterns of large-scale, complex datasets.

As a junior researcher, I'm always open to exploring new and interesting topics in stats/biostats, so if you have a topic that might interest both of us, feel free to reach out!

During my undergraduate study, it's a great honor for me to work with Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) and Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/) on graphon models as my first research project. I spend a wonderful summer at [UMich](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) collaborating with Prof. [Ji Zhu](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/) and Prof. [Gongjun Xu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu) on generative models for attributed hypergraphs, an experience that has greatly enriched my academic journey.

Please feel free to call me _Faye_ both for ease of pronunciation and my perference. I am originally from [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai).

My favorite sports include archery (with recurve bows) and shooting (with air rifles). These sports combine strength, precision, and focus, and I look forward to continuing regular training throughout my PhD studies! :)
