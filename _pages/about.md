I am currently an undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. I am planning to apply for a PhD position in Statistics for Fall 2026.

My research interests lie broadly in statistics. I investigate various problems in statistical network analysis, with a focus on graphon estimation. In addition to these areas, I am open to diving into other aspects of statistical theory and methodologies, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities within the field. 

It's very fortunate for me to work with Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) and Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/).

**Miscs**: Please feel free to call me Faye Ma. I'd like to use Faye instead of Feiyan in academic settings both for ease of pronunciation and for my personal preferences. I am originally from [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai).
