I am currently an undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. **<u>I am applying for a PhD position in Statistics for Fall 2026</u>**.

My research interests broadly span statistical network analysis, including graphon estimation, latent space models, and (hyper)graph data analysis. I develop statistical methodologies to analyze large-scale, complex-structured datasets.

Additionally, I'm always open to exploring new and interesting topics in stats/biostats, so if you have a project that might interest both of us, feel free to reach out!

It's a great honor for me to work with Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) and Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/) on graphon models as my first research project. I spend a wonderful summer at UMich collaborating with Prof. [Ji Zhu](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/) and Prof. [Gongjun Xu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu) on hypergraph generation, an experience that has greatly enriched my academic journey.

Please feel free to call me Faye. I am originally from [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai).

My favorite sports include archery and shooting. At Tsinghua, I'm training with a recurve bow and air rifle. These sports combine strength, precision, and focus, and I look forward to continuing regular training throughout my PhD studies! :)
