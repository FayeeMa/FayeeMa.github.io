I am currently an undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. I am planning to apply for a PhD position in Statistics for Fall 2026.

My research interests lie broadly in statistical network analysis, including graphon estimation, network reconstruction and hypergraph modeling. I develop statistical methodologies to better understand underlying structural patterns in complex systems. In addition to these areas, I am open to seeking new challenges and opportunities within the field. 

I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) and Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/) at Tsinghua on topics related to graphon models. It is also a great honor to collaborate remotely with Prof. [Jing Ma](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/jing-ma) at the University of Washington on network reconstruction this spring. This summer, I look forward to visiting UMich to collaborate with Prof. [Ji Zhu](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/) and Prof. [Gongjun Xu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu).

Please feel free to call me Faye Ma. I'd like to use Faye instead of Feiyan in academic settings both for ease of pronunciation and for my personal preferences. I am originally from [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai).

My favourite sports include Archery and Shooting. I'm currently training with a recurve bow for archery, as well as with air rifles and air guns for shooting. These sports offer a great mix of strength, precision and focus, and I hope to participate in competitions one day.
