I am currently an undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. **I am planning to apply for a PhD position in Statistics for Fall 2026**.

My research interests lie broadly in statistical network analysis, including graphon estimation, network reconstruction and hypergraph modeling. I develop statistical methodologies to better understand underlying structures in complex systems. 

I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) and Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/) on topics related to graphon models. It is a great honor to collaborate remotely with Prof. [Jing Ma](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/jing-ma) at UW on network reconstruction this spring. This summer, I'm visiting UMich to collaborate with Prof. [Ji Zhu](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/) and Prof. [Gongjun Xu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu), which provides an excellent opportunity to learn from and contribute to their research.

Please feel free to call me Faye. I am originally from [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai).

My favorite sports include archery and shooting. At Tsinghua, I'm training with a recurve bow and air rifles. These sports combine strength, precision, and focus, and I look forward to participating in amateur competitions one day.
