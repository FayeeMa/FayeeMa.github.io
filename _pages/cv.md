# Education

Undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University.

I am officially in my fourth year of undergraduate study, but I plan to delay my graduation by one year due to the pace of my academic progress. Thus I plan to apply for PhD programs in statistics in 2026 Fall.


# Skills

- Programming:  R, Python, LaTeX, Git
  
- Language: Chinese (native), English (TOEFL 108 (R30/L26/S23/W29)), French (second foreign language)

# Publications & Manuscripts
*(\* indicates equal contribution.)*

**(Manuscript)** Xinyuan Fan\*, Feiyan Ma\*, Chenlei Leng, Weichi Wu. "Additive Seperable Graphon Models". (to appear on arXiv)

# Research Experiences

Additive Seperable Graphon Models (2024.03-2024.12)

Supervised by Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm) and Prof. [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/).

- We propose a novel approach that directly leverages a low-rank representation of the graphon for parsimonious modeling. This representation naturally yields both a low-rank connection probability matrix and a low-rank graphon — two tasks that are often infeasible in existing literature — while also addressing the well-known identification issues in graphon estimation.

- By exploiting the additive structure of this representation, we develop an efficient sequential fitting algorithm that estimates the low-rank connection matrix using subgraph counts and reconstructs the graphon function through interpolation. 
        
- We provide the convergence rate of our method, and validate its computational efficiency and estimation accuracy through comprehensive simulation studies.
