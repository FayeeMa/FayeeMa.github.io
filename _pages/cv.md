# Education
Undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University.

I am officially in my fourth year of undergraduate study, but I plan to delay my graduation by one year due to the pace of my academic progress. Thus I plan to apply for PhD programs in statistics in 2026 Fall.

Additive Seperable Graphon Models (2024.03-2024.12)

Supervised by Prof. [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm)

- We use the additive separable model as a parsimonious representation of the graphon, capable of generating a low-rank connection probability matrix for network data. 

- We develop an efficient estimation approach that leverages subgraph counts to estimate the low-rank connection matrix and uses interpolation to recover the graphon functions, achieving the minimax optimal estimation rate. This model effectively addresses the well-known identification challenges associated with graphon functions. 
        
- We provide the convergence rate of our method, and validate its computational efficiency and estimation accuracy through comprehensive simulation studies.
