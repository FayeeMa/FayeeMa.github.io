We use the additive separable model as a parsimonious representation of the graphon, capable of generating a low-rank connection probability matrix for network data. We develop an efficient estimation approach that leverages subgraph counts to estimate the low-rank connection matrix and uses interpolation to recover the graphon functions, achieving the minimax optimal estimation rate. This model effectively addresses the well-known identification challenges associated with graphon functions. We provide the convergence rate of our method, and validate its computational efficiency and estimation accuracy through comprehensive simulation studies.
